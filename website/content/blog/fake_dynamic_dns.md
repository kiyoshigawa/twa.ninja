This is just a simple script I run from my home server to a remote one, so I can keep my local ip address updated and remote in with ease. I run it every 15 minutes as a cronjob, and it generates a timestamped file stating when the ip was last updated, as well as a script to let me automatically log in to the most recently recorded ip.


It uses https://twa.ninja/ip.php to generate a string code of the datestamp and ip address. Feel free to use my site, or make your own similar setup.
