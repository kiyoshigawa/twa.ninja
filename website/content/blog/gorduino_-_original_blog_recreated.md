This is another recreated blog post from thetransistor.com. Gordo actually did all the work on this one, but I wanted to preserve this piece of tT history on my own blog for the future.


***Project Overview***


The Gorduino is a PCB board layout designed to work with our Minimalist Arduino Kits. It was designed by Gordon Cooper with input from other Transistor Members. Features include:


* Access to all Arduino pins (D0-D13, and A0-A5)
* Ground Pins adjacent to all Digital Pins
* 5V Rail and Ground Rail adjacent to all Analog Pins for ease of sensor use
* USB/External Power Selector Jumper Pin
* Single sided board for easy home reproduction
* Small form factor compared to typical Arduino footprint


***Eagle Schematic Files***


**Files for v0.3a (Current Version):**  

(See download links below)


Changes from v0.2a:


* Added 5V rail on analog pins.
* General cleanup and trace size/position changes.


**Files for v0.2a (Zombie Defense Version):**
