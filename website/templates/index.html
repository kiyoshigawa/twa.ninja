<div class="body-content" id="body-content">
	<p>Tim Anderson (also known around the internet as <em>kiyoshigawa</em>) is a Utah-native maker / hacker, and this is his personal website. It's here as a place to show off some of the things that Tim has done. The <a href="/blog">Blog</a> has writeups for many of his projects over the years, as well as anything else he thought was interesting enough to put up on the internet. The <a href="/github">GitHub</a> page has links to some of his more interesting GitHub repos, so you don't need to wade through all the old repos from the distant past to find something interesting.</p>
	<p>Tim has been a member of the local utah Hackerspace / Makerspace scene since its inception in late summer of 2009 with HackSLC. HackSLC later became the Transistor, which currently still persists as <a href="https://801labs.org/">801 Labs</a>. He was also a founding member of <a href="https://makesaltlake.org">MakeSLC</a>, though he doesn't get around to visiting MakeSLC of late. He wrote a <a href="/blog/utah_hackerspace_history">blog post</a> about the history of the local hackerspaces and the general timelines related to their founding since people are always asking about them.</p>
